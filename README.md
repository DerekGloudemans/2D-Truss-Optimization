# 2D-Truss-Optimization

Truss.m contains a Matlab used to represent a physical 2D truss as node coordinates and member cross sections. 

The truss can be used to finding member forces and deflections according to the first order matrix stiffness 
method, given a load condition

An additional function optimizes the overall cost of the bridge (a user-input ratio of member weights and maximum
deflection) by changing member cross-sections and node positions along specified free axes
